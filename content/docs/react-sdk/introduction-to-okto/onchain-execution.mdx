## What is an Order?

An **order** in Okto represents a request or instruction to perform a specific action, such as transferring tokens, interacting with a smart contract, or executing any blockchain-based transaction. Under the hood, an order consists of several components that manage the entire transaction lifecycle across various chains.

When an order is initiated, it goes through several states—each representing a stage of the transaction lifecycle. The order also has a unique **order ID** that links to other components such as job IDs and transaction hashes, which track the execution process.

## Transaction Lifecycle in Okto

The transaction lifecycle in Okto follows a specific flow, marked by different **order states**. Each state reflects the status of the transaction at a given point, providing insight into its execution.

### Order States and Lifecycle

1. **Running**: When the transaction is initiated, it enters the **Running** state. In this state, the transaction is being processed and validated on the blockchain.
   
2. **Failed**: If any error occurs during the execution (e.g., insufficient funds, network issues), the transaction moves to the **Failed** state. The order may be retried or flagged for further investigation.

3. **Successful**: Upon completion, the transaction enters the **Successful** state, indicating that the action has been executed on the blockchain, and the desired outcome has been achieved.

### State Transition Diagram

The state transitions depend on network conditions, and the estimated time for each state can vary based on the chain. For example:

- **EVM Chains (Ethereum, Polygon)**: Transaction time can range from a few seconds to a few minutes.
- **Solana**: Transactions are typically confirmed in a few seconds.
- **Aptos**: Confirmation times are generally very fast, often under a second.

## Order ID, Job ID, and Bulk Order ID vs Transaction Hash

In Okto, each transaction is tracked using different identifiers:

- **Order ID**: Represents a single order, such as a token transfer or a contract call. Each order corresponds to one or more jobs.
- **Job ID**: A sub-task within an order, where each job may represent a step or a part of the overall order.
- **Bulk Order ID**: Used when multiple orders are processed together as part of a larger batch. A bulk order consists of multiple individual orders grouped together for efficiency.
- **Transaction Hash**: The actual hash produced by the blockchain when the transaction is executed. A single bulk order may result in multiple transaction hashes, depending on the number of jobs involved.

**Relationship (1:n)**: 
- **Order ID** : **Job ID** = 1:n 
- **Bulk Order ID** : **Transaction Hash** = 1:n

This structure allows Okto to efficiently track and manage multiple transactions and ensure that each step of the process is monitored accurately.

## What is an Order Type?

**Order Type** classifies the different kinds of orders that can be executed on the Okto platform. Orders can be categorized based on the actions they perform, such as:

1. **Token Transfer**: Moving tokens from one address to another.
2. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Executing functions on smart contracts.
3. **NFT Minting**: Creating new NFTs on the blockchain.
4. **DeFi Orders**: Orders related to liquidity provision, staking, or other DeFi operations.

Each order type is identified at the time of creation and affects the subsequent flow through the order states. By classifying the orders, Okto can provide tailored management and tracking mechanisms for different transaction types.

## Conclusion

In Okto, an order is more than just a transaction—it is a lifecycle-managed process with multiple states, tracked through various IDs. Understanding the relationship between **Order ID**, **Job ID**, **Bulk Order ID**, and **Transaction Hash**, along with the classification of order types, helps developers efficiently manage transactions on the Okto platform.
