## Create Web, Android and iOS Client IDs on your Google Cloud Project.

1. Follow this [guide](/docs/flutter-sdk/advanced-sdk-config/authenticate-users/google-oauth/google-console-setup) to create all the client IDs.

## Android Setup
1. After creating the Android & Web Client ID
2. Copy the Web Client ID.
3. Create a file `strings.xml` in `android/app/src/main/res/values/` folder, if its not already present.
4. Add the following code to `strings.xml` file
```dart
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

</resources>
```
5. And, we are good to go for Android.
