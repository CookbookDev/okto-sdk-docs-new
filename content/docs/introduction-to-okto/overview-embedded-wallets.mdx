## Embedded wallet

Embedded wallets are cryptocurrency wallets integrated directly into decentralized applications (dApps), websites or  web2 application, enabling seamless user experiences without needing to leave the platform to manage crypto assets or handle complex processes like gas fees. Embedded wallets simplify interactions by allowing users to perform transactions, manage tokens, and interact with blockchain networks directly within the application, without needing to install additional software or browser extensions. In contrast, self-custody wallets like MetaMask or Phantom are standalone applications that users must install and manage independently, providing full control over their private keys and requiring more manual setup and interaction when connecting to dApps. Embedded wallets are a key component in making Web3 more accessible to mainstream users, providing an easy and intuitive way to interact with decentralized technologies.

## Key Features of Embedded Wallets:

1. **User-Friendly Onboarding**: New users can create and use wallets within the app itself, without needing to download external applications or extensions. This lowers the barrier to entry for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. Okto support various web2 like authentication methods to further reduce onboarding friction.
2. **Seamless Transactions**: Transactions such as sending tokens, minting NFTs, or interacting with smart contracts can be done without switching between different applications, making the process smoother.
3. **Security**: Embedded wallets like Okto Lite utilize secure elements like multi-party computation (MPC) or other cryptographic techniques to ensure private keys are kept secure, even within the dApp.
4. **Cross-Platform Access**: These wallets are accessible across various platforms (web, mobile) and are often designed to work smoothly in different environments.
Custodial vs. Non-Custodial: Embedded wallets can be either custodial (where the private keys are managed by a third party) or non-custodial (where the user retains full control over their keys). At okto we offer both options

## Using Embedded Wallets in Web2 Applications

Web3 embedded wallets can be used in both Web2 and Web3 apps to enhance user experiences by providing integrated, seamless access to blockchain functionalities without requiring users to leave the platform or install additional software.
In Web2 apps, embedded wallets can be integrated to introduce blockchain features, such as enabling cryptocurrency payments, offering tokenized rewards, or allowing users to interact with NFTs, all within the familiar Web2 environment. This integration helps Web2 apps leverage blockchain technology without requiring users or developer to have prior experience with cryptocurrencies, thereby bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. By embedding a wallet directly into the app, users can seamlessly participate in blockchain-related activities like earning and using tokens or interacting with decentralized services, which can drive higher engagement and retention by enhancing the overall user experience.

Overall, embedded wallets serve as a bridge between Web2 and Web3, allowing traditional applications to incorporate decentralized features while providing Web3 applications with a more streamlined user experience.

## Interoperable wallets vs Closed-loop wallets

Interoperable wallets are designed to function across multiple platforms, networks, and applications, allowing users to manage their digital assets and interact with decentralized services across different blockchain ecosystems. These wallets provide cross-platform compatibility, enabling users to access a wide range of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and dApps, regardless of the specific blockchain networks or applications. This flexibility is particularly valuable in a Web3 environment, where users might want to interact with various decentralized services, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces, without being confined to a single ecosystem. Interoperable wallets enhance user experience by offering a unified interface for managing assets across multiple chains, promoting ease of use and broader access to decentralized technologies.

In contrast, closed-loop wallets are restricted to a specific platform, application, or network. These wallets are typically designed for use within a particular ecosystem, where they support only the assets and services associated with that environment. For example, a closed-loop wallet might be tied to a specific dApp, allowing users to perform transactions or manage assets only within that application. While this can simplify the user experience within the given context, it limits flexibility by preventing users from interacting with other platforms or blockchains. Closed-loop wallets are often used in environments where tight control over the user experience and security is a priority, but they can also create barriers to broader participation in the decentralized economy.

Okto Lite Wallets are interoperable wallets.
