## Oktoâ€™s Suite of Products

At Okto, we are dedicated to enhancing the web3 onboarding experience by building a comprehensive orchestration layer that simplifies chain, account, transaction, and fee abstraction for both users and developers. 

## Okto Wallet 

Okto Wallet is the most powerful self-custody web3 trading wallet. It is available on Android and iOS allowing users to make effortless trades for maximum return and to avail airdrops. It is the easiest way for passive income and Defi opportunities. Our platform features a self-custody MPC wallet that supports a single asset portfolio with seamless interoperability across more than 30 chains, including EVM, Solana, Aptos, Cosmos, and others. Additionally, we offer regulated on-ramp and off-ramp features and a gas station service that allows users to pay gas fees with any stable token they possess on any chain. Our wallet is currently utilized by over 1.5 million users and has witnessed significant transaction volume, reflecting our rapid growth. Learn more [here](https://www.okto.tech/).

## Okto Lite

Okto Lite is the fastest and easiest way a developer can build on Web3. Okto Lite offers interoperable embedded wallets for developers to onboard users on Web3 in a web2 like experiance. Developer can convert their web2 applications to web3 in a few simple steps. Okto Lite help decouple The fragmented and ever evolving world of web3 from user/dev onboarding obstacles, UI/UX and business logic making it the ultimate solution to making web3 dapps mainstream. It is available in multiple frontend frameworks most suited for your Dapp and across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Our SDK allows the Okto wallet to be embedded in any web2 app transforming it almost instantly to web3 without the web2 developers having to learn web3 concepts. This Docs will cover in detail what Okto Lite is and how to use it. Learn more [here](https://www.okto.tech/lite-sdk)

Note that Okto Lite and Okto App are independent of each other. Okto Wallet helps users take advantage of Defi opportunities in a Web2 like interface while Okto Lite help developers build for web3 while abstracting out the complexities.

While the implementation behind Okto Lite remains largely centralised as of now, we want to stay true to the core values of web3 and make our platform decentralised. As we progress towards our goal of mass user onboarding into web3, we are excited to announce the launch of our own chain and associated decentralised modules as part of our orchestration layer. This initiative is aligned with the web3 principles of transparency and decentralization. The Okto chain will not hold any TVL but will instead facilitate transaction management in an account and chain-abstracted manner to ease the user burden within this fragmented ecosystem. Our purpose, vision, and objectives are outlined in detail in our [whitepaper](whitepaper.okto.tech).
