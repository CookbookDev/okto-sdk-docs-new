## Wallet Structure

### Central Wallets for Each Chain
The Okto SDK utilizes **central wallets** for each supported blockchain. These wallets act as the main point for transaction facilitation, abstracting away complexities for the end-user. All transactions related to a particular chain are handled through the respective central wallet, without exposing the end-user to direct wallet management or private key handling.

### Sponsor Wallets
**Sponsor wallets** are employed to cover transaction costs for users, particularly for gas fees. This ensures users can interact with dApps and make transactions without worrying about maintaining token balances for gas. The sponsor wallet steps in to pay the necessary fees on behalf of the user, making the interaction seamless.

### Nonce Wallets (Specific to Solana)
For Solana-based operations, **nonce wallets** are used to manage the nonce (sequence number) associated with each transaction. This is particularly crucial for Solana’s system where transaction ordering and management require a nonce to prevent replay attacks and ensure the integrity of sequential operations.

### What This Means
The architecture separates concerns, ensuring the vendor does not receive or manage any addresses directly on the blockchain. Instead, the vendor interacts with these central, sponsor, and nonce wallets depending on the use case. Each wallet type serves a specific role in facilitating secure and seamless transactions while minimizing user complexity.

## Key Considerations for Using the Okto SDK

- **Transaction Management**: You should be aware of the different wallet types and the role they play in the transaction flow. Always ensure proper handling of sponsor wallets, particularly for gas-related operations, to avoid failed transactions.
- **Nonce Management**: For Solana, it's important to correctly manage nonce values when dealing with transaction sequences. The SDK provides tools to assist with this, but careful attention is needed to avoid conflicts.
- **Chain-specific Behavior**: Different chains have their unique transaction requirements. Ensure your implementation accounts for these chain-specific behaviors when deploying your app on multiple blockchains.

## Supported Frameworks

The Okto React SDK currently supports the following frameworks:

- **React**: Full support for React.js applications, enabling seamless integration of Okto’s wallet functionality into existing React projects.
- **Next.js**: Support for Next.js, including server-side rendering considerations for wallet functionality.
- **Other Frontend Frameworks**: We are continuously working on extending support to other frameworks. Check back for updates on compatibility with frameworks like Vue.js and Angular.

## Deploying Contracts

As of now, you will need to deploy your own smart contracts on the respective blockchains. While Okto provides wallet and transaction facilitation, the responsibility of deploying and maintaining your contracts remains with you.

## Conclusion

The Okto React SDK simplifies wallet management for dApp developers, abstracting away many of the complexities involved in handling blockchain transactions. Understanding the underlying architecture, particularly the central, sponsor, and nonce wallets, is key to effectively leveraging the SDK in your project. As support for more frameworks and contract deployments evolves, Okto aims to further streamline the dApp development process.
